# Vanguard.com
My clone version of the website Vanguard.com

This was a project I decided to build to solidify what I've learnt throught HTML & CSS. 
There is no Javascript involved, just a simple clone of a popular website. 
You will see that my code became marginally cleaner throughout the stylesheet because I was learning more tricks along the way. 
This took me a few months to finish as I was recording my progress to Youtube.com/@ProdigalP. Please check it out!
